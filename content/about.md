Hi folks,

I'm a hardware engineer turned blockchain developer with a passion for complex systems, deep tech, and building value-driven products. My career began in chip design, where I spent 3 years as a chip designer at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com), diving into hardware development and the intricacies of embedded systems. I then shifted to software and joined [Shovel Company](https://shovel.company), where I embraced a new world of possibilities in software engineering.

For three years, I served as Blockchain Engineer at [Hubble Exchange](https://www.hubble.exchange/), a perpetual decentralized exchange on the Avalanche network. At Hubble, I took full ownership of smart contracts, designed a unique perpetual exchange protocol, and managed the development lifecycle from EVM integrations to backend indexing for events and APIs.

Today, I'm working on my latest venture, [Moar Market](https://moar.market), a leveraged lending protocol on Aptos. Moar Market allows users to leverage their assets for greater lending potential, bringing enhanced financial tools and strategies to the Aptos ecosystem.

Outside of work, you'll find me lost in techno and house musicâ€”[Ben BÃ¶hmer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5tDjiBYUsTqzd0RkTZxK7u) and [Monolink](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2I4hRNCYkPKJQlkoEZKjYx) are my go-to artistsâ€”and indulging my inner Marvel fan (Ironman will always be my favorite ðŸ¦¾).

Love to connect with like-minded folks! Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xshinobii).
