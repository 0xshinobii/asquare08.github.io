Hi folks,

I am a hardware engineer turned software developer. I started my journey as a chip designer at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com) for 3 years, switched to the software world, and joined [Shovel Company](https:/shovel.company).

Currently, I am a blockchain developer at [DefiDollar](https://defidollar.finance). I love working on complex math equations and building products on the Ethereum ecosystem.

Love techno and house music, [Ben Böhmer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5tDjiBYUsTqzd0RkTZxK7u) and [Monolink](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2I4hRNCYkPKJQlkoEZKjYx) are my favorite. Marvel Fan, Ironman is ❤️

Love to hear from you at atulagarwal893[at]gmail.com or DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asquare08).
